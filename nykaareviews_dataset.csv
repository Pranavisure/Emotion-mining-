Srishti Raaj,Very Nice Product . It is very light weighted and quickly gets absorbed so that you don't feel creamy when you get out using this. It gives a smooth feeling to our skin and will not irritated your skin at all. This product is a lotion and not a moisturizer so it is not a replaced for that this is baby lotion too. It works very well for your skin.As this is not an oily lotion which will not make you sweat even in hot summer It smells good and leaves skin smooth afterwards. Even though this is a baby lotion people with very sensitive skin can also use this one as it is good for damaged skin too. After using for many years now I can say it rebuilds your skin.Himalaya is now not using Paraben for Baby lotion so the lotion is safe than before.

Rashmi Krishnanand,"This was recommended by my mother as it is what she used when she was expecting and she doesn‚Äôt have a single stretch mark. The lotion is more effective in preventing stretch marks than in fading existing ones. Stretch marks occur when there is a tear in the fibers in the skin when it expands. It is also genetic, meaning if your mother had a lot of stretch marks when pregnant, chances are high than you will too. Stretch marks may fade with time but never completely go away with any topical creams. However, research shows that 1. Massage and 2. Moisturizing help in preventing the appearance of stretch marks.
I started using this product in my third month of pregnancy and have no marks on my tummy. I used it diligently twice a day, once in the morning post a shower and once at bedtime, by massaging it into the skin. I noticed that when applied once, the lotion keeps the skin moisturized for the entire day, even when your clothes rub against your skin all day. As your pregnancy progresses, the skin on your tummy becomes very itchy, red, dry and sensitive. This lotion takes care of all these issues. Highly recommended.",4,4,True,,2020-03-20 09:47:02,aa8fee02-1b23-5b2b-80e7-ac81c67460f0,"2021-07-31, 15:16:43"

Rashmi Krishnanand,"This was recommended by my mother as it is what she used when she was expecting and she doesn‚Äôt have a single stretch mark. The lotion is more effective in preventing stretch marks than in fading existing ones. Stretch marks occur when there is a tear in the fibers in the skin when it expands. It is also genetic, meaning if your mother had a lot of stretch marks when pregnant, chances are high than you will too. Stretch marks may fade with time but never completely go away with any topical creams. However, research shows that 1. Massage and 2. Moisturizing help in preventing the appearance of stretch marks.
I started using this product in my third month of pregnancy and have no marks on my tummy. I used it diligently twice a day, once in the morning post a shower and once at bedtime, by massaging it into the skin. I noticed that when applied once, the lotion keeps the skin moisturized for the entire day, even when your clothes rub against your skin all day. As your pregnancy progresses, the skin on your tummy becomes very itchy, red, dry and sensitive. This lotion takes care of all these issues. Highly recommended.",4,4,True,,2020-03-20 09:47:02,aa8fee02-1b23-5b2b-80e7-ac81c67460f0,"2021-07-31, 15:19:37"
